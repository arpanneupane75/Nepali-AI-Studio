# Nepali AI Studio: Speech-to-Text & Summarization

üé§ **Nepali AI Studio** is an advanced AI-powered web application that converts Nepali speech into text and generates concise summaries of the transcribed content. Built with **Streamlit**, **PyTorch**, and **Hugging Face Transformers**, this project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** and **Text Summarization** in Nepali.

## Demo

- Upload or record Nepali audio and instantly get the transcript.
- Generate a concise summary of long spoken content.
- Download both transcript and summary as text files.

---

## Features

- **Nepali Speech-to-Text** using `iamTangsang/Wav2Vec2_XLS-R-300m_Nepali_ASR`.
- **Text Summarization** using `csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum`.
- Real-time audio recording or file upload (WAV, MP3, M4A).
- Clear and user-friendly web interface with Streamlit.
- Downloadable transcript and summary.
- Session state handling for multiple audio inputs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Nepali_speech_recognition_Summarizer
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> Ensure you have a working microphone for recording, or upload audio files in WAV/MP3/M4A format.
